# Link-Management

## Overview
The **Link-Management** is a full-stack application for managing and processing links. It utilizes a **React** frontend for an interactive user experience and a **Node.js** backend with **MongoDB** as the database to handle API requests and manage link data.

## Tech Stack
- **Client**: React.js
  - A modern JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
  - A robust web framework for building scalable backend services.
- **Database**: MongoDB
  - A NoSQL database used for storing and managing link-related data.

## Features
- **Link Management**: Create, read, update, and delete links.
- **Responsive UI**: React-based UI for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Supports real-time updates for link status and data.
- **Authentication**: Secure login and user management system.

## Database
MongoDB is used to store the application's data, including:
- User data
- Link information
- Link processing details

### Collections
- **Users**: Stores user details and authentication information.
- **Links**: Stores the link data, including URL, description, status, etc.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version x.x.x or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for managing dependencies)
- **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or set up a cloud MongoDB service.

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone "https://github.com/aak998/link-management"
    cd Link-Management
    ```
2. Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Configure environment variables (refer to `.env.example` for required variables, including MongoDB URI).
4. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The frontend should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
